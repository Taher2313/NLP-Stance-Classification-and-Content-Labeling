# NLP-Stance-Classification-and-Content-Labeling
In this project, the aim was to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for two main tasks: detecting the stance towards COVID-19 in tweets and classifying the content type of tweets. To achieve this, several preprocessing steps were applied, including word normalization and stemming. Various feature extraction techniques, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Frequency Vector, and Word Embeddings, were employed to represent the tweet data.

Several machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, LSTM, and SVM, were implemented to compare their performance in tackling the given tasks. Additionally, the issue of class imbalance in the data was addressed by employing the SMOTE technique, which helps in generating synthetic samples for the under-represented class.

Among the models tested, the Bert Transformer model emerged as the most effective, producing highly accurate results for both training and test data. This indicates that the powerful capabilities of the Bert Transformer were well-suited for the specific challenges posed by the detection of COVID-19 stance and tweet content classification in this NLP project.
